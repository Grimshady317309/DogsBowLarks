here are the steps to replicate the matrix movie in your Kali Linux terminal
 
sudo curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/will8211/unimatrix/master/unimatrix.py -o /usr/local/bin/unimatrix
 
sudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/unimatrix 
 
unimatrix -l s -l k -b -s 96 
 
This should turn your terminal into the data stream off the movie.
 
then you need to install the retro terminal.
 
sudo apt install cool-retro-term
 
after you have done that you will find it in the applications menu under " Cool Retro Term"
 
In this terminal right click on the display to change the color to green and retype 
 
unimatrix -l s -l k -b -s 96

And for the message  to Neo I just typed it out in nano text editor LOL.
 
and thats it hope you enjoy :)
